This repo is a collection of a few projects I have completed in my PHY 2200 class at High Point University

### Lunar Lander
Game in which you attempt to land a spacecraft on a square.
Demonstrates competency in solving ODE's as well as knowledge of python

### Tank Wars
Game in which two tanks take turns firing at eachother until one explodes
Demonstrates competency in solving ODE's as well as knowledge of python

### Heat Diffusion
Simulation in which a constant heat source emits heat and fills up a
grid based on a fixed number of iterations
Demonstrates competency in understanding heat diffusion as well as how to
create an accurate simulation in vpython to display it
